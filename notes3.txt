Let me think through this step by step:

When to use:
Math problems
Logical reasoning
Complex analysis
Multi-step processes

Best practices:

Set temperature to 0 for consistent reasoning
Extract final answers separately from reasoning

SHow working
Example: 
1-Maths Problem (algebra problem)  
2-Making a dish 
3-Trip to area

Need conformation of a particular thing

1-Doctor headache consultant
2- Car engine
3- buying a house
